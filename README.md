# KnuthBitops
Algorithms from "Bitwise Tricks and Techniques" of Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming"
This is pretty much the complete set of bit operations from Knuth.  The most interesting,
difficult and fun one is the one to permute bits in a word.  Well worth programming even if
it never gets used.
